# Mobile Legends Player Clustering Analysis

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that combines advanced player analytics with practical gaming tools. The application features:

1. **Clustering Analysis System**: Comparative analysis of K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms for segmenting Mobile Legends players based on performance and gameplay patterns in the Medan region
2. **Draft Pick System**: AI-powered draft advisor with comprehensive hero database (129 heroes) and intelligent counter recommendations for ranked matches

The project serves as both a research tool for clustering algorithms in gaming analytics and a practical assistant for competitive Mobile Legends gameplay.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Structure**: Modular architecture with separate components for data processing, clustering, visualization, and draft management
- **Components**:
  - `app.py`: Main Flask application with route handlers for clustering and draft systems
  - `main.py`: Application entry point
  - `data_processor.py`: Data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering
  - `clustering_engine.py`: Implementation of K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms
  - `visualization.py`: Plotly-based interactive visualization engine
  - `draft_pick_system.py`: Complete draft pick system with 129 heroes and counter matrix

### Frontend Architecture
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templating with Bootstrap dark theme
- **Styling**: Bootstrap CSS with custom dark theme styling
- **Interactivity**: JavaScript for real-time algorithm parameter controls
- **Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts and graphs

### Data Processing Pipeline

#### Primary Data (Authentic Survey Data)
1. **Data Loading**: Loads two CSV datasets (`pemain_medan.csv`, `match_history_sample.csv`)
2. **Data Merging**: Combines datasets based on `player_id`
3. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Calculates `avg_kda = (kills + assists) / deaths`
   - Computes `match_frequency = total_matches / total_days`
   - One-Hot encodes categorical features (`main_role`)
4. **Normalization**: MinMaxScaler for numerical features
5. **Final Features**: `['win_rate', 'avg_kda', 'match_frequency', 'role_Fighter', 'role_Mage', ...]`

#### Secondary Data (External Gaming Analytics)
**Data Sources Simulated:**
1. **Rank Statistics Database** (1000 players):
   - Player rank data: Epic (500), Legend (300), Mythic (150), Grandmaster (40), Mythical Glory (10)
   - Season performance: matches played, winrate, rank points
   - Account metrics: level, heroes owned, battle points earned
   - Engagement data: MVP count, legend count, credit score, activity patterns

2. **Hero Meta Analytics** (80 heroes across 5 roles):
   - **Combat Statistics**: pick rate, ban rate, win rate, meta score
   - **Hero Classification**: role, tier ranking (S+, S, A+, A, B), difficulty level
   - **Economic Data**: gold cost, skin count, release year, rework history
   - **Competitive Metrics**: tournament presence, counter potential, team fight rating
   - **Game Phase Performance**: early game power, late game power

**Integration Features:**
- Combines primary survey data with external analytics
- Creates composite metrics: rank_numeric, normalized_rank_points, experience_score
- Enhanced clustering with 6 features: primary (3) + secondary (3)
- Supports comparative analysis between data source methodologies

## Key Components

### Visualization Engine (`visualization.py`)
- Creates interactive scatter plots using Plotly
- Generates cluster comparison visualizations
- Supports real-time parameter adjustment

### Draft Pick System (`draft_pick_system.py`)
- Complete hero database with 129 Mobile Legends heroes across 5 roles
- Comprehensive counter matrix for meta heroes with strategic recommendations
- Rank-based ban sequences (Epic: 6 bans, Legend: 8 bans, Mythic: 10 bans)
- AI-powered counter recommendations during pick phase
- Session management for draft state persistence
